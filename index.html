                                    worked a lot of jobs since graduating college, none of which were in my fields but
                                    it's taught me a lot about working with people and finding out where my interests
                                    lie. Currently I'm employed at a game/hobby retail store in Lawrence, KS and while I

                                    Windows 3.1 and got to watch the internet develop from the AOL disk days onward.
                                    Recently I decided to take the plunge into web development by enrolling in a coding
                                    bootcamp at the University of Kansas. It has definitely been one of the more
                                    difficult undertakings in my life but very rewarding and enlightening to learn how
                                    all the pieces fit together to make a functioning and aesthetically pleasing
                                    website.</p>
